# Dasm macro assembler for VSCode

This is a dasm macro assembler extension for Visual Studio Code. It aims to provide the following in-editor features:

* Powerful dasm-compatible assembly source editing for the 6502 and others
* Assembling and exporting generated byte code
* Running Atari VCS 2600 code with full debugging and run-as-you-type abilities

Notice, however, that this extension is a work-in-progress and that many features do not work yet.

## Features

So far, the following features are supported:

### Basic syntax highlighting

![Syntax highlighting](images/syntax-highlight.png)

### Real error checking as you type

## More immediate TODO tasks

The next tasks in the roadmap are:

* [Language support for editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/language-support)
  * More syntax highlight
* [Language server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-language-server)
  * Error checks: constants, labels ([Diagnostics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/language-support#_provide-diagnostics))
  * Navigate to labels
  * Grab the file missing error and use that in the list diagnostics (it does not come in the error list). Example: `Warning: Unable to open \'whatever.h\'', 'Complete.`
  * Parse unresolved symbol list? It also comes in the output
  * Support incremental document sync
  * Resolve the include files problem
  * Auto completion
    * Add all registers, instructions
    * Add symbols
    * Add labels
* Debugger support
* Play compiled game on Javatari tab
* Use [6502.ts](https://github.com/6502ts/6502.ts) instead of Javatari? Might not work at all (needs TIA, etc)

## Contibuting

Bug reports, fixes, and other changes are welcomed. Our repository is [on GitHub](https://github.com/zeh/vscode-dasm).

## Acknowledgements

This extension uses the original [dasm macro assembler](http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/) via [dasmjs](https://github.com/zeh/dasmjs), an [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)-compiled version of the original C code.

It also uses [Javatari](https://github.com/ppeccin/javatari.js) to preview Atari-compatible ROMs.

And finally, this extension was heavily inspired by the [8bitworkshop](http://8bitworkshop.com/?platform=vcs&file=examples%2Fhello) web-based Atari development IDE (but shares no code with it except for its reliance on Javatari). One could say this extension is an attempt to create a similar Atari development experience, but within a dedicated standalone desktop application.

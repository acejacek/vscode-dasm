# Roadmap

This extension is an early work-in-progress. As such, there is much left to be done.

For now, the major milestones in our roadmap are:

* **Emulator support**: developers should be able to not only write code with the aid of this extension, but to test their game on a separate tab within the editor itself. This will open up the door to several more advanced development features.

* **Debugger support**: modern development concepts such as step-by-step execution, address/value watching, and stack tracing, can and should be added to the extension when running games within the editor.

* **Live/hot reloading**: finally, concepts used in some development platforms such as live compiling and reloading (on save) and hot reloading (modifying the code as it runs) should make Atari VCS/6502 development iterative and more fun than ever before.

For a more granural view of what's in the pipeline, you can check [our public Trello roadmap](https://trello.com/b/aQNGQnSk/vscode-dasm-public-roadmap). This makes it easier to track what's in progress, what's next, and what kind of ideas are currently being evaluated.

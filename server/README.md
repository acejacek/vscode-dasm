# VSCode dasm language server

This is a language server implementation for the [vscode-dasm](https://github.com/zeh/vscode-dasm) extension for VSCode.

This repository should not normally be used by anyone. The server code is compiled and embedded into the main (client) VSCode extension instead.

This is based on Microsoft's own [vscode-languageserver-node-example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node-example) reference implementation.

# VSCode dasm language server

This is a language server implementation for the [vscode-dasm](https://github.com/zeh/vscode-dasm) extension for VSCode. The server code is compiled and embedded into the main (client).

This is based on Microsoft's own [vscode-languageserver-node-example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node-example) reference implementation.
